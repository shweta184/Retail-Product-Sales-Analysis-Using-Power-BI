## 📌 Key Insights

- 💰 The business generated **$1.6M in sales** with a **profit of $175K**, indicating positive margins but also room to increase profitability through targeted cost or discount control.
- 🗂️ **Office Supplies** had the highest sales, but **Technology** delivered the most profit. This suggests that while some categories move high volume, others contribute more to bottom-line results and should be prioritized in promotions or bundling strategies.
- 🪑 Top sub-categories like **Phones**, **Chairs**, and **Binders** dominated performance, highlighting where inventory turnover is highest and where customer demand is strongest.
- 👤 The **Consumer segment** accounted for over 50% of total quantity sold, indicating a strong presence in the B2C space. Business strategies should continue focusing on this segment through personalized offers.
- 🌍 The **West and East regions** outperformed others in both sales and profit, with the **West region alone contributing ~$0.52M**. Marketing campaigns and resource allocation can be optimized around these high-performing regions.
- 💳 **Cash on Delivery (43%)** was the most preferred payment method, which indicates the need for efficient cash handling systems and possible incentives for online payments to reduce risk.
